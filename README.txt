Ad Hoc Network Simulator with Collision Detection and Avoidance

Authors: Christopher Bird and Blake Tacklind
Proposed Finish Date: 10th March, 2015
Date of Recent Major Update: 8th March, 2015

Purpose: Design and Simulate a flexible ad hoc network that has N hosts who all wish to send packets
at negativly-distributed times based on a lambda and mu value. Each process signals separately, but
there is only one channel between all hosts, and so only one packet can be sent at a time. Each
sent packet must have an ACK packet sent back after the SIFS time of .05 msec. After the DIFS time of
.1 msec, the channel is free again to have a packet sent. When a collision is detected, all attempeted
senders generate a backoff time (that is different but on the same scale) and resend packet at the
determined time.

Remaining Issues:
*Packets are not yet generated by hosts
*Simulation test values are not yet set or tested
*After redefining what lists/queues are needed in the code, some have been left unused. Must be removed
as list.next is referenced which causes a fault in the code.
